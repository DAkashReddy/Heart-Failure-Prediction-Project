# Heart Failure Prediction Project

## Overview
The Heart Failure Prediction Project is an analytical and predictive modeling endeavor, aimed at determining the likelihood of heart failure from clinical data. The centerpiece of this project is a Tableau dashboard that showcases an in-depth visualization of a subset of the original patient data, specifically selected to aid in the discovery of actionable insights regarding key health indicators.

## Objectives
Our objectives are multifaceted, aiming to:

- Evaluate key health indicators from patient data to uncover patterns and correlations related to heart failure.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart failure with high accuracy.
- Provide a visual tool for healthcare professionals to assess heart failure risk and make evidence-based decisions.

## Tools Used
The project leverages several tools for its execution:

- **Python & Scikit-learn**: for creating and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Tableau**: for developing interactive and informative dashboards.
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: for data wrangling and visualization.

## Dashboard Visualization
Our interactive dashboard provides a clear visual narrative of the clinical data, featuring:

- Statistics on the patient population and observed mortality rates.
- Impact of comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes on patient survival.
- Age-related insights and their correlation with patient outcomes.

## Insights and Findings
The visualization and analysis led to significant findings:

- Key health indicators, notably ejection fraction and serum creatinine levels, are critical in heart failure prediction.
- A notable correlation was observed between comorbidities and patient survival rates, which can be crucial for preemptive healthcare measures.

## Conclusion
This project stands at the intersection of machine learning and data visualization, converting complex clinical data into actionable insights. It is a stride forward in supporting healthcare providers with tools for proactive patient care management.
